# Design patterns in F#

This repository is an attempt to solve common design problems in functional world which could have been solved by using GOF design patterns in an OO world.

To begin with lets list out the GOF design patterns:

## Creational Patterns
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Factory Method
* Prototype
* Singleton

## Structural Patterns

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy

## Behavioural Patterns

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpretor
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template method
* Visitor

Please note that in object oriented world, an object consists of both data and behavior. However, in a functional world we have functions that operate on data and give a new data.

Some of the design problems may not come in a functional world at all due to the separation of function and the data.
